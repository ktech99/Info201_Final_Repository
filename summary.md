## Dataset Background
We are working with the *“​Seattle police department 911 response dataset​”*.
This data set contains data about 911 calls made and their time, coordinates
and grouping/subgrouping about the type of complaint.
This dataset is extremely large with about a couple million rows of data.
For the purpose of this project we will be using a random collection of 50,000 rows to create visualizations

## Research Questions
- How can we help Seattle PD recognize which areas and crimes need more attention?
- Is the negative perception of Marijuana and its role as a catalyst for crime supported by Statistical data?

## Why is this important?
- We can help Seattle PD recognize which crimes need more attention so that they can take preventive action
- We can help them aware of the trend of crimes over the years
- We can draw attention to which times of the day need more attention to crimes
- We can help decrease the stigma of violence and crime correlating to crimes

## Questions of Interest
1. Which area of Seattle has the most density of crime?
2. How does crime correlate to a particular time during the day?
3. What kind of crimes are prevalent across different years?
4. Did Marijuana legalization affect crime rates in Seattle? If so, how?

## Conclusions
- Crime rates in fact, decreased drastically after marijuana legalization
- Area with most density of crime is Downtown Seattle across all years
- Our data could be more helpful if we had Seattle PD response times so that we could assess their effectiveness
