# Project Proposal

## Team Members
- Anhad Dhillon, Saasha Mor (Section BE)
- Divit Jawa, Kartik Arora (Section BF)
## Project Description

We’ll be working with the *“​Seattle police department 911 response dataset​”*.
This data set provides a plethora of data to work with which allows us to
answer many questions and draw constructive conclusions about crime in
Seattle. Our final goal is to create a shiny app to comprehensively answer 
questions about the safety of people in Seattle


## Dataset Background

This data set contains data about 911 calls made and their time, coordinates
and grouping/subgrouping about the type of complaint.

It makes the data generated by the City of Seattle openly available to the
public for the purpose of increasing transparency, accountability and
comparability; promoting economic development and research; and
improving internal performance management. (“City of Seattle Open Data 
Portal.” ​ Seattle​ , ![](​data.seattle.gov​)

## Target Audience

- People who shifted to Seattle that need to find safe areas to live
- Students
- Homeless people
- UWPD

## Questions of Interest

1. Which area of Seattle has the most density of crime?
2. Which type of crime is prevalent in a particular area in Seattle?
3. How does crime rate correlate to a particular day of the week?
4. How does crime correlate to a particular time during the day?
5. Which type of crime is the most prevalent on the UW campus?
6. How do calls for assaults at the UW campus compare to those across
    the rest of Seattle?
7. What kind of crimes(noise complaints, liquor violations and threats and
    harassments) are prevalent on the Greek row at UW?

## Technical Description

### Project Format

Our final project would be a Shiny app, which allows for most versatility
and flexibility in terms the data we can display.

### Reading Data

We will be obtaining our data with a downloaded CSV file which has
data till the year 2016.


### Statistical Questions

- What percentage of crimes were “ASSAULTS”?
- Which district had the least crime rate in 2014?
- Which district had the highest crime rate overall?
- How many thefts were reported throughout the years(entire
dataset)?
- How many ‘FALSE ALARMS’ were there in 2016?

### Libraries Used
- ggplot
- Plotly
- Shiny
- httr
### Anticipated Challenges

- Data collected might be outdated and may not reflect accurate results
for the users today
- Visualizing data before performing huge operations to answer our
questions
