# Project Proposal

## Team Members
- Anhad Dhillon, Saasha Mor (Section BE)
- Divit Jawa, Kartik Arora (Section BF)
## Project Description

We’ll be working with the *“​Seattle police department 911 response dataset​”*.
This data set provides a plethora of data to work with which allows us to
answer many questions and draw constructive conclusions about crime in
Seattle. Our final goal is to create a shiny app to comprehensively answer 
questions about the safety of people in Seattle


## Dataset Background

This data set contains data about 911 calls made and their time, coordinates
and grouping/subgrouping about the type of complaint.

It makes the data generated by the City of Seattle openly available to the
public for the purpose of increasing transparency, accountability and
comparability; promoting economic development and research; and
improving internal performance management. (“City of Seattle Open Data 
Portal.” ​ Seattle​ , ![](​data.seattle.gov​)

## Target Audience

- People who shifted to Seattle that need to find safe areas to live
- Students
- Homeless people
- Seattle PD

## Research Questions
- How can we help Seattle PD recognize which areas and crimes need more attention?
- Is the negative perception of Marijuana and its role as a catalyst for crime supported by Statistical data?

## Questions of Interest

1. Which area of Seattle has the most density of crime?
2. How does crime correlate to a particular time during the day?
3. What kind of crimes are prevalent across different years?
4. Did Marijuana legalization affect crime rates in Seattle? If so, how?
5. Does crime correlate to days of the week?

## Technical Description

### Project Format

Our final project would be a Shiny app, which allows for most versatility
and flexibility in terms the data we can display.

### Reading Data

We will be obtaining our data with a downloaded CSV file which has
data till the year 2016.


### Statistical Questions

- What was the change in crime rates before and after Marijuana legalization?
- Which crimes became more or less prevalent before and after Marijuana legalization
- Which district had the least crime rate across time?
- Which district had the highest crime rate overall?
- Do weekdays have more crime rates than weekends?

### Libraries Used
- ggplot
- Plotly
- Shiny
- httr
### Anticipated Challenges

- Data collected might be outdated and may not reflect accurate results
for the users today
- Visualizing data before performing huge operations to answer our
questions

## Reflection and conclusions
- Crime rates infact, decreased drastically after marijuana legalization [insert stats]
- Area with most density of crime is --- across all years
- Weekends do have less crime than weekdays
- Our data could be more helpful if we had Seattle PD response times so that we could assess their effectiveness
